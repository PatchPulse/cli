## Installation

No installation required! Just ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed to use npx.

## Quick Start

Navigate to your project's root directory and run:

```bash
npx patch-pulse
```

That's it! Patch Pulse will scan your `package.json` and show you which dependencies are out of date.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Check all dependencies in current directory
npx patch-pulse

# Show help information
npx patch-pulse --help

# Show version information
npx patch-pulse --version
```

### What Gets Checked

Patch Pulse automatically checks all dependency types in your `package.json`:

- **dependencies** - Production dependencies
- **devDependencies** - Development dependencies
- **peerDependencies** - Peer dependencies
- **optionalDependencies** - Optional dependencies

## Example
