Plans for today!

- Testing (Unit, Integration, etc.)
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Workflows)

OR

- Automatically detect package manager for specific repsonses (e.g. `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, `bun`)
- Configurable options (i.e. `.patchpulserc` file, and normal CLI flags)
  - `packageManager` (npm, pnpm, yarn, bun)
  - overwrite path to `package.json`

OR

- Copy update commands to i.e. either patch, minor, major (dependent on detecting package manager)
